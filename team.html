        Dr. Edward Eisenstein is a Fellow in the Institute for Bioscience and
        Biotechnology Research and an Associate Professor in the Fischell
        Department of Bioengineering at the University of Maryland. Trained in
        synthetic biology and protein engineering, his current research
        interests are focused on protein and biosystem engineering for
        applications in plants such as biofuels and pathogen resistance. He has
        advised the Umaryland iGEM team since 2014 and is an active leader of
        the iGEM Engineering and Steering Committees.Â

        Dr. Jason D. Kahn is a biophysical chemist who studies protein-nucleic
        acid interaction and engineering. He is best known for studies of DNA
        looping, bending, twisting, and cyclization, as well as hybridization
        thermodynamics for modified bases. He teaches a variety of chemistry,
        biochemistry, and molecular biology courses, which he credits for
        initiating his interest in synthetic biology. With Dr. Eisenstein, he
        has mentored UMaryland iGEM since 2014.

          Abhi is a sophomore chemical engineering and computer science double major 
          from Urbana, Maryland, currently serving as modeling chair. He is interested 
          in how computational methods can speed and scale up the pace of research and 
          therapeutics production. After college he plans to pursue a Ph.D. and hopefully get
          involved in biotech research and development. In his free time he enjoys camping, 
          photography, board games, and music.

          Mia is a sophomore bioengineering major who is pursuing a minor in Science, Technology,
           Ethics, and Policy (STEP). She is eager to continue exploring her interest in health equity engineering. 
           As Mia progresses in her career, she seeks to prioritize her focus on groups that are systemically hindered 
           from receiving adequate medical care. For the last two cycles Mia has been chair of the UMaryland iGEM Wet Lab Committee, 
           and is also involved in Human Practices/Outreach. She is from Annapolis, Maryland and enjoys hiking, swimming, and stargazing.
           Mia has no idea what she wants to do in industry, as she is just a girl
